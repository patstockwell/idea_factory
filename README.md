An ongoing project to think creatively and produce business and artistic ideas.

## The List

### [Chipset music lessons](./chipset_music_lessons.md)
- Learn music improvisation through short lessons delivered in a style reminiscent of 8 bit computer games.

### block soap
- The last part of the soap bar, the small thin portion left after many lathers, is often thrown out or left to fall apart and clog the drain.
- Create soap bars that have a shallow indentation that could fit the old soap bar.

### personalised soap bars
- sell soap online, where each bar has a personalised name stamp.

### photo measuring
- Take a digital photo of a ruler lying next to any object and the app can measure the object
- The app will find the ruler in the picture, save the pixel distance of one centimetre, and then measure any points mapped out on the photo
