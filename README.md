# The Idea Factory - Learn you an idea for great good
An ongoing project to think creatively and produce business and artistic ideas.

## The List

### [Chipset music lessons](./chipset_music_lessons.md)
- Learn music improvisation through short lessons delivered in a style reminiscent of 8 bit computer games.

### block soap
- The last part of the soap bar, the small thin portion left after many lathers, is often thrown out or left to fall apart and clog the drain.
- Create soap bars that have a shallow indentation that could fit the old soap bar.

### personalised soap bars
- sell soap online, where each bar has a personalised name stamp.

### photo measuring
- Take a digital photo of any object along with a special brightly-coloured, square-centimetre sticker, and the app can measure the object
- The app will find the square sticker in the picture, save the pixel distance of one centimetre, and then measure any points mapped out on the photo

### coffee compare
- a site that allows people to upload photos of coffees along with the name, the place they bought it, and the price.
- a latte ordered in a Collingwood cafe can be wildly different from one bought in Rome, which is different again from Las Vagas.

### succulent desk delivery
- plants don't travel well in the mail. The only plant that might would be a succulent. 
- sell tiny succulent plants online. Each plant is potted in a connectable pot. Buy many plants and snap them together to create a small garden.
- target office workers, companies who employee office workers, students, artists.
